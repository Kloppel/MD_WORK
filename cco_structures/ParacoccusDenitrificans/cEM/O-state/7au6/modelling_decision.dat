  Decision: prot__<RESNAME>-<RESID>_<SEGNAME/CHAIN>
  Options:  HSE - Set to HSE. (default)
            HSD - Set to HSD.
            HSP - Set to HSP.

# Some residues have been found that are not known to Charmm. (1xPEO 2xHEA 6xOXY)
  Decision: delete_unknown
  Options:  yes - Delete the residues. (default)
            no  - Keep them.
  Chosen:   yes

# Capping of termini will be decided here. Should they be caped?
  Decision: cap_termini
  Options:  cap - Apply patches in Charmm to cap termini if not true termini. (default)
            dont_cap  - Do nothing, apply regular termini patches!

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname ACHA

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname BCHA

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname EHEM

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname GHEM

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname META

# There are 1 disulphide bridges in the structure. Should they be closed?
  Decision: disu_bridges
  Options:  closed - Apply patches in Charmm to connect the CYS pairs. (default)
            open   - Do nothing, CYS pairs will NOT be bound! 
  Chosen:   closed

# There are 6107 protein, 24 ligand and 0 water hydrogens missing. Should they be modelled?:
  Decision: missing_hydrogens
  Options:  model - Model and optimize all hydrogens. (default)
            [keep  - Do not model any hydrogen.] option currently not available
  Chosen:   model
