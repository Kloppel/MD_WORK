### The following changes have been applied to the structure. ###
# Capping of termini will be decided here. Should they be caped?
  Decision: cap_termini
  Options:  cap - Apply patches in Charmm to cap termini if not true termini. (default)
            dont_cap  - Do nothing, apply regular termini patches!

  Chosen:   cap for segname ACHA

  Chosen:   cap for segname BCHA

  Chosen:   cap for segname EHEM

  Chosen:   cap for segname GHEM

# There are 1 disulphide bridges in the structure. Should they be closed?
  Decision: disu_bridges
  Options:  closed - Apply patches in Charmm to connect the CYS pairs. (default)
            open   - Do nothing, CYS pairs will NOT be bound! 
  Chosen:   closed

# There are 10 protein and 0 ligand atoms missing. Should they be modelled?:
  Missing atoms: PRA-560_GHEM: CBA CGA O1A O2A CAA 
                 PRA-559_EHEM: CBA CGA O1A O2A CAA 
  Decision: missing_atoms
  Options:  model - Model all missing atoms. (default)
            [keep  - Do not model any (non hydrogen) atoms.] option currently not available
  Chosen:   model

# There are 6065 protein, 0 ligand and 0 water hydrogens missing. Should they be modelled?:
  Decision: missing_hydrogens
  Options:  model - Model and optimize all hydrogens. (default)
            [keep  - Do not model any hydrogen.] option currently not available
  Chosen:   model
