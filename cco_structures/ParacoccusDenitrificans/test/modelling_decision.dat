### The following changes have been applied to the structure. ###
# Residue of type HOH must be renamed in order to be recognised by Charmm.
  Decision: rename__HOH_TIP3
  Options:  rename - Rename to TIP3 (default)
            keep   - Do nothing.
  Chosen:   rename

# There are 24 HIS residues in the structure. The default setting will be used for 24 of them.
  Decision: prot__<RESNAME>-<RESID>_<SEGNAME/CHAIN>
  Options:  HSE - Set to HSE. (default)
            HSD - Set to HSD.
            HSP - Set to HSP.
  Chosen:   HSE-28_ACHA:HSE HSE-59_ACHA:HSE HSE-85_ACHA:HSE HSE-94_ACHA:HSE HSE-119_ACHA:HSE
            HSE-187_ACHA:HSE HSE-269_ACHA:HSE HSE-276_ACHA:HSE HSE-292_ACHA:HSE HSE-325_ACHA:HSE

            HSE-73_BCHA:HSE HSE-119_BCHA:HSE HSE-181_BCHA:HSE HSE-224_BCHA:HSE

# Some residues have been found that are not known to Charmm. (9xLDA)
  Decision: delete_unknown
  Options:  yes - Delete the residues. (default)
            no  - Keep them.
  Chosen:   yes

# Capping of termini will be decided here. Should they be caped?
  Decision: cap_termini
  Options:  cap - Apply patches in Charmm to cap termini if not true termini. (default)
            dont_cap  - Do nothing, apply regular termini patches!

  Chosen:   cap for segname ACHA

  Chosen:   cap for segname BCHA

  Chosen:   cap for segname HOH

# There are 1 disulphide bridges in the structure. Should they be closed?
  Decision: disu_bridges
  Options:  closed - Apply patches in Charmm to connect the CYS pairs. (default)
            open   - Do nothing, CYS pairs will NOT be bound! 
  Chosen:   closed

# There are 6065 protein, 0 ligand and 84 water hydrogens missing. Should they be modelled?:
  Decision: missing_hydrogens
  Options:  model - Model and optimize all hydrogens. (default)
            [keep  - Do not model any hydrogen.] option currently not available
  Chosen:   model
