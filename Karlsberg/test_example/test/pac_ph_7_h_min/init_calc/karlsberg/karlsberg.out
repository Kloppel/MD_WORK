Move statistics for single moves at 300K:
    - each scan comprised 0 single moves at 300K (on average)
    - 0 single moves at 300K were performed
    - 0 single moves at 300K were accepted
    - acceptance is -nan%

Average energies for 300.00K:
    - the average energy is  -657.09 kJ/mol.
    - the second momentum is 431765.51 (kJ/mol)^2.
    - the variance is        0.00 kJ/mol.
