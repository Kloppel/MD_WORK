### The following changes have been applied to the structure. ###
# Some residues have been found that are not known to Charmm. (1xMN)
  Decision: delete_unknown
  Options:  yes - Delete the residues. (default)
            no  - Keep them.
  Chosen:   yes

# A gap has been found in the resid numbering AND in the structure.
  Decision: gap__CU1-3_M__CAL-5_M
  Options:  keep       - Do nothing, the gap remains in the structure.
            model/keep - Try to extract the missing sequence from the PDB header.
                         If possible and if the length of the missing sequence is
                         smaller than 10, the gap will be modelled. Otherwise the gap 
                         will be kept.(default)
            <sequence> - Model the missing residues with the given sequence. 
                         The sequence must be space separated three letter codes. 
  Chosen:   model/keep

# Capping of termini will be decided here. Should they be caped?
  Decision: cap_termini
  Options:  cap - Apply patches in Charmm to cap termini if not true termini. (default)
            dont_cap  - Do nothing, apply regular termini patches!

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname A

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname B

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname E

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname F

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname G

  Chosen:   dont_cap for segname M

# There are 1 disulphide bridges in the structure. Should they be closed?
  Decision: disu_bridges
  Options:  closed - Apply patches in Charmm to connect the CYS pairs. (default)
            open   - Do nothing, CYS pairs will NOT be bound! 
  Chosen:   closed

# There are 6191 protein, 0 ligand and 0 water hydrogens missing. Should they be modelled?:
  Decision: missing_hydrogens
  Options:  model - Model and optimize all hydrogens. (default)
            [keep  - Do not model any hydrogen.] option currently not available
  Chosen:   model
